# User Design Workshop

Garreth is a city planner and he is stressed because he can't be on every road at once to gather traffic data all hours of the day.

Ideas to solve the problem of gathering traffic data for city planners:
- A series of 1D laser sensors that intersect the road horizontally (if single lane) or looks down (if multi-lane).
    - Can determine frequency and speed of vehicles moving across road.
    - No speed bumps.
    - Can estimate the weight of the vehicle by its size.
    - Easier to implement than CV.
- Hire someone to stand on the road and count the cars.

## Presentation

> Meet Gareth the city planner. He is stressed because he doesn't know where to put bike lanes on the roads. Our idea is to place speed bumps on roads where bike lanes can be made. These speed bumps differentiate between bikes and cars/trucks using a weight threshold. When the bump goes down, the kinetic energy is transformed into electric energy which is used to send the data back to Gareth. Now Gareth will know which roads need bikes and he is no longer stressed.
