# Empathise 🥺

User-focused thinking of problem spaces and refinement of a problem statement.

## Brainstorming Problem Areas 🧠

Brainstorm problem areas related to energy, energy harvesting, and energy loss in order to develop a problem statement.

### Energy Types

Brainstormed energy types to set the parameters of the project brief.

## Researching Problem Areas 🧩

Further research into problem areas to:
- Identify the stakeholders within these problem spaces.
- The marketability of the problem.
- The innovativeness of the problem.
- Presence of data and previous research.
