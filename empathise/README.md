# Empathise 🥺

User-focused thinking of problem spaces and refinement of a problem statement.

## Work Packages 💼

- Brainstorm problem spaces related to energy, energy harvesting, and energy loss.
- Evaluate problem spaces to narrow down the problem spaces.
- Identify the stakeholders within these problem spaces.
- Define a problem statement from a selected problem space with stakeholders in mind.
- Identify stakeholder/user requirements.

## Brainstorming 🧠

### Problem Constraints

- Stick to the city(?)
- Output energy is electrical.

### Energy Types

- Thermal
- Pressure
- Vibrations
- Kinetic
- Hydro
- Magnetic
- Electrical
- Potential

### Energy Sources

- Sun
- Wind
- Waves
- Rivers
- Movement
    - Human
    - Cows
    - Cars
- Vibrations
- Sound
- Thermal
    - Geothermal
    - Body
    - Building ventilation exhaust
- Non-renewables

### Human Movement

A shoe that when stepped, generates energy.

### Car Movement

Cars driving over speed-bumps that generate energy when compressed.

### Solar Space Energy

Solar panels in space then send energy to Earth.

### Concentrated Solar Panel

Solar panels in 

### Street Gutters

A generator in a gutter can capture water-flow to generate energy.

### Stormwater Generator

Expanding off the [street gutters](#street-gutters).

We can place generators in larger tunnels in a city's stormwater drainage system (basically building a dam off stormwater). Potential stakeholders would be:
- All residents of the city.
- Entities responsible for city stormwater drainage.
- Entities responsible for city energy delivery.

This might see great success in regions that:
- Experience wet seasons and could significantly decrease the use of carbon fuels during these seasons.
- Located far from dams.

### Building Ventilation Exhaust

City buildings are huge and use massive amounts of air to ventilate a building. Used air is just wasted by its exhaust into the atmosphere. We can capture this used air by placing generators at the air exhaust points of buildings.

Someone [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6365985B1/en) this idea? But this patent is very small scale and doesn't tackle industrial level air conditioning.
