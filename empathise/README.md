# Empathise 🥺

User-focused thinking of problem spaces and refinement of a problem statement.

## Brainstorming Problem Areas 🧠

Brainstorm problem areas related to energy, energy harvesting, and energy loss in order to develop a problem statement.

### Energy Types

Brainstormed energy types to set the parameters of the project brief.

### Energy Sources

Brainstormed general sources of energy.

This then expanded to include specific sources of energy focused around energy loss.

## Researching Problem Areas 🧩

Further research into problem areas to:
- Identify the stakeholders within these problem spaces.
- The marketability of the problem.
- Presence of data and previous research.
- The innovativeness of the problem i.e. presencen existing solutions and their innovativeness.

## Evaluating Problem Areas 🤔

Evaluate problem areas to narrow down the problem areas.

This was a three step process:
1. Identify the selection criteria to measure the problem areas against.
1. Conducting a pair-wise comparison chart to weigh the selection criteria in terms of importance to us.
1. Filling a best-of-class chart to score the problem areas with the selection criteria weighting.

## User Requirements 🤝

User requirements elaborate on what our personas want.

What do they want? Why do they want it?
