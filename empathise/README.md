- Easy to think too low-level early which will derail the process.
- Large search space can result in too much time used for brainstorming.

## Evaluating Problem Areas ü§î

Evaluate problem areas to narrow down the problem areas. The deliverable for this work package is a single problem space that the team wants to solve.

<details><summary>Risks</summary>

- Not knowing how to fill out the charts.

</details>

This was a three step process:
1. Identify the selection criteria to measure the problem areas against.
1. Conducting a pair-wise comparison (PCC) chart to weigh the selection criteria in terms of importance to us.
1. Filling a best-of-class (BOC) chart to score the problem areas with the selection criteria weighting.

> This work was done within a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Y5BLjWYeOzdiXMWd3SZe7I68tTQgj5_khv4GgHinzo/edit?usp=sharing).

### Selection Criteria

The identified selection criteria for problem areas are:
- Stakeholder Impact.
- Number of Stakeholders.
- Complementary Impacts.
- Innovativeness.
- Compatibility with Report Requirements.
- Realistic/Feasible.

## Problem Statement ‚ÅâÔ∏è

A problem statement sets the objective for the team.

<details><summary>Risks</summary>

- Team not on the same page as the problem statement.

</details>

From the selection of a problem space from the evaluation step, a problem statement was then defined:

> The ever-increasing environmental impact of urban cities is an evolving concern. Worldwide, 1/5 of building energy consumption is air conditioning use - exhausting hot air directly into the atmosphere which is consequently wasted. By capturing and harvesting the energy of the exhausted air, we can reuse the energy to power devices which directly benefit the residents.

## Identifying Stakeholders üë•

Identifying stakeholders is an important first step of user-centred design. It sets the parameters of who to consider when solving the problem.

The identified stakeholders were:
- Building inhabitants.
- Energy consumers.
- Building manager, building owner.
- Environmentalists.
- City planners, council.
- Architects.
- Ventilation companies.

## Creating Personas üë§

After identification of the stakeholders, we expand on who these stakeholders are to make them more relatable to us as people and to the problem.

We also need to ask our personas:
- What do they want?
- Why do they want it?

User requirements elaborate on what our personas want. The user requirements we use are in the form of user stories:
```
As a [user], I want to [need], so I can [context]
```

    <th>Environments</th>
    <td>Chetan lives in a hot tropical climate with wet and dry seasons. The region‚Äôs average yearly temperature is 27.3¬∞ C.<br><br>

The provincial capital (which is where Chetan currently lives) is a rapidly developing city. However, the city (especially the poorer neighbourhoods) is prone to electrical outages due to an inefficient, outdated, and overworked electricity grid.

![image](/uploads/4c5b153719b0e0820a870dcf8c8212a2/image.png)

His hometown had higher rates of poverty and lacked AC units due to their high price. Chetan‚Äôs family uses standing fans as they are extremely cheap.

![image](/uploads/4890ee5d73e2daffb7df5e5bf96df99f/image.png)

Chetan‚Äôs workplace is a shared office outfitted with a single outdated AC which struggles to effectively cool the entire space. This is most noticeable when all employees are in the office, and the office is only a couple degrees cooler than outside.

Chetan‚Äôs gym is not outfitted with an AC unit. The gym gets very hot especially when there are multiple patrons.

Chetan having recently starting his consulting career is renting a cheap unit and is saving up to buy his own apartment in the provincial capital.

Strongly motivated by his desire to buy his own home. Chetan does what he can to save money, even if it means enduring the heat in his home. Chetan wants to buy a home in a more affluent neighbourhood as this neighbourhood provides better services and utilities.

Chetan is naturally comfortable in taking risks as he is young and ambitious.

Chetan looks forward to travelling around the country every holiday with his workmates. This holiday is sponsored by his workplace.

Chetan however is saving up to buy an apartment so he does not want to invest money into this technology personally if it was installed in his current unit.
