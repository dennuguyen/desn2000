- Easy to think too low-level early which will derail the process.
- Large search space can result in too much time used for brainstorming.

## Evaluating Problem Areas ü§î

Evaluate problem areas to narrow down the problem areas. The deliverable for this work package is a single problem space that the team wants to solve.

<details><summary>Risks</summary>

- Not knowing how to fill out the charts.

</details>

This was a three step process:
1. Identify the selection criteria to measure the problem areas against.
1. Conducting a pair-wise comparison (PCC) chart to weigh the selection criteria in terms of importance to us.
1. Filling a best-of-class (BOC) chart to score the problem areas with the selection criteria weighting.

> This work was done within a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Y5BLjWYeOzdiXMWd3SZe7I68tTQgj5_khv4GgHinzo/edit?usp=sharing).

### Selection Criteria

The identified selection criteria for problem areas are:
- Stakeholder Impact.
- Number of Stakeholders.
- Complementary Impacts.
- Innovativeness.
- Compatibility with Report Requirements.
- Realistic/Feasible.

## Problem Statement ‚ÅâÔ∏è

A problem statement sets the objective for the team.

<details><summary>Risks</summary>

- Team not on the same page as the problem statement.

</details>

From the selection of a problem space from the evaluation step, a problem statement was then defined:

> The ever-increasing environmental impact of urban cities is an evolving concern. Worldwide, 1/5 of building energy consumption is air conditioning use - exhausting hot air directly into the atmosphere which is consequently wasted. By capturing and harvesting the energy of the exhausted air, we can reuse the energy to power devices which directly benefit the residents.

## Identifying Stakeholders üë•

Identifying stakeholders is an important first step of user-centred design. It sets the parameters of who to consider when solving the problem.

The identified stakeholders were:
- Building inhabitants.
- Energy consumers.
- Building manager, building owner.
- Environmentalists.
- City planners, council.
- Architects.
- Ventilation companies.

## Creating Personas üë§

After identification of the stakeholders, we expand on who these stakeholders are to make them more relatable to us as people and to the problem.

## User Requirements ü§ù

We need to ask our personas:
- What do they want?
- Why do they want it?

User requirements elaborate on what our personas want. The user requirements we use are in the form of user stories because:
```
As a [user], I want to [need], so I can [context]
```

## Affinity Map User Requirements to Customer Needs üó∫

For the sake of marks, we're going to map our user requirements to customer needs.
