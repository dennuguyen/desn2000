## Questions we should be prepared for

- @catherinecheng02 How did you come up with the preliminary solutions? Did you follow a process? How does this fit into your roadmap?
- Why should we care about your problem statement?
- Who are you going to market this to and how will you convince them to buy the product?
- How much money do you anticipate the solution will take?
## Questions to other groups

- What future research do you need before you can make a decision on which design you pick?
- How do you anticipate you will split your work responsibilities among your team members?
