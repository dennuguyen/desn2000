# Prototype ðŸ§±

Building a proof-of-concept.

## Work Packages ðŸ’¼

[TOC]

- System design.
- Requirements allocation via an affinity map or matching diagram.
- Cycle of analysis, CAD, simulation.
- Verify solution works (through analysis and simulation).
- Validate solution against requirements.

## System Design ðŸš€

A top-down thinking approach.

### Work Breakdown Structure

Identification of work packages by decomposing the system down into components for implementation.

Since we don't have a real client to get real-time feedback, the waterfall approach makes sense.

### Requirements Allocation ðŸ”‘

Verify that the requirements will be met by allocating requirements to the components.
