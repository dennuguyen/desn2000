## Project Phase README

Each project phase has a `README.md` to completely summarise the work done. The basic structure of the `README.md` is:
1. Table of contents which doubles as a list of work packages/deliverables.
1. Headings that represents work packages/deliverables.
    1. Description and purpose of the work package.
    1. Maybe a dropdown with a list of risks (just project management stuff).
    1. Summary of the work.
    1. Links to external documents.

> Tried to make this low effort to maintain.

## Issue Management ‼️

Each project phase is modelled by our [milestones](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/milestones).

Each deliverable is modelled by our [issues](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues). Most issues will belong to a milestone.
