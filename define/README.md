## Affinity Map CN to FR ðŸ—º

Translating CN to FR lets us shift our user-focused thinking into technical-focused thinking.

Customer needs **are** requirements. However, customer needs may not cleanly translate to the solution which is why functional requirements need to be developed. The tool we use to deduce what our functional requirements are is affinity mapping (which is a method of categorisation).

From our list of customer needs (from this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A06ONjj7tLm_xGvUQfQnWL-As_b0yvIB1bE-RqM8eos/edit), we categorised the customer needs into general requirements. This is the first draft:

We further refined the affinity map into the following as we fleshed out the categories into root functional requirements:

There was a clean trend where `sustain` was closely related to constraints and `improve` was closely to functional requirements.

## FR Hierarchy ðŸŒ³

Decomposition of the highest-level FR into lower-level FRs.

## Defining FR Metrics ðŸ’¯

The definition of metrics helps specify the FR.

## First-Hand Data ðŸ¥¼

First-hand data helps to inform what the FR metrics should be.

We gathered first-hand data by finding AC ventilation and measuring the temperature and airflow.
