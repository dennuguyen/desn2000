## [Affinity Mapping Customer Needs to Functional Requirements](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPThrLNQ=/)

From our list of customer needs from this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A06ONjj7tLm_xGvUQfQnWL-As_b0yvIB1bE-RqM8eos/edit?usp=sharing), we categorised the customer needs into general requirements. This was the first draft:

We then further refined the affinity map into the following as we fleshed out the categories into root functional requirements:

We added `sustain` and `improve` keyword categories (which is roughly analogous to `design constraints` and `functional requirements`).

## [Functional Hierarchy](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPThrLNQ=/)

When the team was happy with the basis of the affinity map, the requirements were translated to a functional hierarchy for decomposition into more descriptive and specific requirements/constraints (note that this image is just a subset of the diagram since it's huge):

- The root node of the functional hierarchy was the problem statement.
- The next level of branching contained `sustain` and `improve`.
- The next level of branching contained the `themes` of the affinity map i.e. the translated customer needs.
- Every level of branching after this were functional requirements or design constraints.
