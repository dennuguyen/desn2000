## Problem Statement Edit
Generalised problem statement after talking to Olivia, as this will give us more scope to explore different applications of the energy that we harvest:

The ever-increasing environmental impact of urban cities is an evolving concern. Worldwide, 1/5 of building energy consumption is air conditioning use - exhausting hot air directly into the atmosphere which is consequently wasted. By capturing and harvesting the energy of the exhausted air, we can reuse the energy to power devices which directly benefit the residents.
## Presentation Progress Updates
- @jjsnacks suggested powering IOT sensor in ventilation that detects COVID - prompted change in our problem statement
- Will reduce the content in the "preliminary design concepts" section, and add a bit more about potential use cases for the energy we harvest, to place more emphasis on impact and meaning.
- Cutting out definitions from "intepretatipn of project brief section" in the interest of time, and focussing more on the criteria behind our decision process.
- Everyone seems on track, no other concerns brought up for other sections besides how to format everything onto the slides
- Top priorities for presentation:
    - Convince the audience why they should care about the problem
    - Show evidence that we've made some progress into thinking about how to solve the problem
    - Delivery and presentation is weighted more than content is, avoid content bombing audience

## Actionables
- Everyone - finish off research and transcribing onto slides
- @jjsnacks - move presentation from ppt to Google Slides.

## Next Meeting

The next meetings will be:
- Sunday 9pm on Teams (to make any final edits to slides, and to do a practice run through of presentation)
- Thursday 12pm at uni (to do a final run through presentation)
