    - rehearse pitch slides (Week 9 Thursday Workshop)
    - hand in pitch slides (Week 9 Sunday)
    - design theory ideas and content (Week 8 Sun)
    - fasteners calcs and content (Week 8 Sun)
    - power transmissions content (Week 8 Sun)
    - CAD and drawings (Week 8 Sun)
- Delegate non technical parts of the report 
- Delegate other misc tasks eg. sketching etc. 

- Redo FR. Since we're going for a turbine solution, we need more specific FR.
- Finalising sketch and actual design 
- User surveys and defining user's problems 
## Pitch structure
### PROBLEM 
- Explanation of the problem and its significance
- Consideration of users when defining the problem was thorough
- User surveys 
- Considerations of user testing?
- Go through updated functional requirements  
### SOLUTION 
- Explanation of why we chose this design over others (pros/cons table)
- Axiomatic design theory matrices
- Sketch + CAD + Drawings 
- Overview of final design + explanation of how it stands out with unique value or novelty
### TECHNICAL
- Convince them of technical feasibility
- Justification of decisions for fasteners and power transmission
- Validation - test, models, calculations, standards or equivalent
- List any assumptions 
## Actionables
- User surveys + problem section of pitch - Mel 
- Prettify FR tree - Nikki
- Axiomatic design theory matrices - Court, Catherine - Sunday
