# Meeting 10 - Week 4 Sunday
## Application ideas 
- Power a greenhouse/urban farm 
- Cycle the hot exhaust air into district heating (New York City uses steam for heating)
    ○ Doesn't satisfy the requirement of converting into electrical energy
- Air filtration system
- Virus/air quality sensor
- Backup power
- Emergency exit signs and alarms
	

## Reviewing design report spec 
- Should we build our prototype for a single case study building?
    ○ Perhaps not, because it doesn't allow us to demonstrate the 
    ○ What are the metrics we need for a particular building that informs/constrains our prototype design?
- Things to keep in mind during concept generation
    ○ What design method are we using?
    ○ Which 2 out of 4 we're picking: Material, fastener, power transmission or sensors
    ○ Do we have enough to put into technical analysis section for the report
    ○ Is it suitable to make a CAD model and assembly
    ○ Can we make it one self contained package?
    ○ Is the application related to the method of harvesting?
		
## Solution concept generation
- Thermoelectric materials + humidity/temperature/AC control system sensor 
    ○ Technical analysis - Could do a deep dive into materials 
    ○ May be limited for high rise buildings because we need more concentrated heat 
    ○ Using passive heat sink to maintain temperature difference 
    ○ Heat energy is not going to be maintained all the time as aircon use isn't constant and reliable - we will need a battery 
    ○ In winter, the exhaust air will be cold due to heater use
- Small scale internal wind turbine + air quality sensor (could have a suite of sensors to choose from - virus, smoke, carbon monoxide)
    ○ Fasteners + Power transmission (maybe sensor as well)
    ○ Technical analysis - CFD simulation, aero, technical comparison between turbine technology, technical comparison between generators
    ○ Very little infrastructure change, self contained and doesn't require wiring (unless we want sensor to be sensing inflow air, which means a bit more wiring)
    ○ Can be used for both inflow and outflow air, doesn't even need to be in a vent 
    ○ CAD and BOM would be substantial 
- Piezoelectric material/EM generator to harvest vibration energy
    ○ Not as efficient as turbine 
- Aerodynamic instability /flutter+ AC control system 
    ○ Airflow isn't always consistently unstable, instability position will change
    ○ Newer technology, not as much data already available 

## Ideate Method

1. Concept generation of harvesting solutions via brainstorming.
2. Concept evaluation of harvesting solutions via PCC/BOC.
3. Continued concept generation of turbine solutions via sketching.
4. Concept evaluation of turbine solutions/application.

## Actionables

- Catching up on lectures specifically design methods.
- Clean up concept generation and evaluation of harvesting solutions.
- Sketching of turbine solutions - detailed, with justification for design choices
- Review everybody's sketches at next meeting.
- Select a turbine solution/application.
- Design journals!!!
- James to make the Overleaf
