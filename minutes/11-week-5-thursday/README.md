### Design Methods
- Axiomatic - match functional requirements to physical domain
- Biological - modelling design off of naturally occurring biological organisms
- TRIZ - if there is a product that is similar to other products existing in the market, 40 x 40 matrix to help you solve problems - separation of time, space
    - Only used to solve for contradictions
- Discussed options
    - will use axiomatic design for design concept generation
    - TRIZ to solve any contradictions that arise

### Group turbine design and research
- Mel
    - Take other people's turbine and make it smaller
    - Bladeless turbine:
        - Won't interfere with airflow in vents - building still needs adequate ventilation
        - Airflow changes a lot depending on building size
        - Turbine needs to have a range of speeds and work in multiple directions
        - Fit in smaller spaces
        - Put multiple in a row without interference between 
        - Lower energy output compared to blade turbines but can put more 
		- Not much research
		- Requires solid foundations - may be hard to secure
    - Accelerate air before it enters turbine - may be loud
- Catherine
	- Turbine requirements
		- Efficient for low airspeeds - approx. 2-3 m/s
		- Doesn't give rise to large turbulence
			- Avoid putting it near bends, at start of HVAC or put at exhaust 
			- If we put it at the exhaust - it has already gone around multiple bends 
		- Suitable for small spaces
		- No loud noise or vibration
		- Adjust to wind direction
		- Where we put the turbine 
	- Vertical axis
		- Needs to backtrack - rotates against direction of wind
		- Can adjust to wind direction
		- Handles turbulent wind and slower wind better
	- Guide component for air - funnels air (cone shape)
- James 
	- Venturi tunnel to accelerate air speed
	- Resistant to turbulent - should not affect power output
		- How to deal with turbulent air? Make sure air leaving is not turbulent 
	- Funnel air in
	- Fan with tail - automatically corrects itself with the fin 
- Court
	- Cross flow turbines
		- Modelled off of water mill
		- Low noise, low maintenance
		- Increases airflow
		- Very robust
- Nikki
	- Turbine type considerations
		- Number of blades - odd numbers is good, less number of blades
		- Turbine tip ratio
		- Angle of the blades
		- Blade design
		- Blade length
	    - Blade pitch/angle

### Clarifications from Olivia
- Independence Axiom - which features of your sketches addresses specific functional requirements
- Apply design methods to 2-3 design concepts 
- Links for TRIZ tutorials

**Actionables**
- Research types of HVAC systems - what is the airflow like? 
- Research different types of turbulence in internal flow
- Read axiomatic design theory 
- Review fasteners and power transmission lectures
