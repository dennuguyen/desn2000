## Discussion
Going through all of the ideas we conducted individual research on over the weekend (ideas in this doc:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lhBVNqQttMCyS-LZkeU3rhdo17ehIDjxk5FEoXpYh4c/edit?usp=sharing)

Ranked our selection criteria using a pairwise comparison chart:
		1. compatibility with report
		2. innovativeness
		3. biggest impact on stakeholders
		4. realistic 
		5. complementary impacts
        6. widest reach

We will need to make a matrix as well to assess our ideas based on the rankings we determined.

## Harvesting Road Heat Energy - Using heat exchanger under asphalt
- What are we going to do with the heat?
- How viable is this for existing roads?
    - More difficult to add to existing roads, but can add this when asphalt is replaced. Would be ideal to do it for new roads
	- Need to consider electrical insulation, waterproofing from weather conditions
- Good marketability
