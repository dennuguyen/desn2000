## Agenda
- We were first a bit confused about how to start brainstorming functional requirements, so we asked a couple of questions to Olivia about where to start and what we are supposed to consider 
- Figure out problem statement, then brainstorm customers/stakeholders, customer needs, functional requirements

## [Problem Statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A06ONjj7tLm_xGvUQfQnWL-As_b0yvIB1bE-RqM8eos/edit?usp=sharing)
- Include general statement about wasted energy in urban areas and the large heat footprint of urban spaces 
- Drill into wasted energy of building exhuasts 
- Statistics from [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling)
    - Rising demand for space cooling is also putting enormous strain on electricity systems in many countries, as well as driving up emissions
    - In fact, the use of air conditioners and electric fans already accounts for about a fifth of the total electricity in buildings around the world â€“ or 10% of all global electricity consumption. 
- Brainstormed ideas for problem statement as a group on [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPThrLNQ=/)
- Problem statement (written up by Courtney)
    - The ever-increasing heat footprint of urban cities is an evolving environmental concern. Worldwide, 1/5 of building energy consumption is air conditioning use - directly releasing excess heat energy into the atmosphere without moderation. By capturing and harvesting this heat energy, a significant reduction in urban heat footprints could be achieved.


## [Customer Needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A06ONjj7tLm_xGvUQfQnWL-As_b0yvIB1bE-RqM8eos/edit?usp=sharing)
- Brainstormed different customers and stakeholders
- Considered needs of each customer/stakeholder 


## Actionables
The following work needs to be delegated in the next meeting:
- Problem statement (written up by Courtney)
    - Context, scientific research, get more statistics
    - Design problem
- Functional requirements (affinity mapping + hierarchy)
- Design constraints
- Preliminary Solutions (more research into existing ideas)
- User personas: Dan (@dennuguyen)
- Gantt Chart: Nikki (@nikkifang)
- Organisation of slides 

Next Meeting: Sunday 25th 8pm
