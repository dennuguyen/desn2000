## [Review of Research Problem Area Task](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/22)
	- Skyscraper turbine/ vertical turbines for urban areas
		â—‹ Not ideal to do skyscraper turbines because that's already been done before
		â—‹ Like the idea of vertical turbines on street level to power lamp posts 
	- Harvesting energy from human motion from portable devices (shoes, keyboard)
		â—‹ Sources say we can't get enough energy from keyboard keystrokes to power something meaningful 
		â—‹ Could use piezoelectric material from sugarcane waste?
		â—‹ Don't see a huge market for this, as it has already been attempted before with little success
		
	- Prosthetic devices
		â—‹ Good option for user-centric design 
		â—‹ Easy to model in CAD 
		â—‹ One topic area will have to be materials
		â—‹ Question for Olivia - how in depth do we need to go into safety and regulations?
	- Noise pollution at transport hubs/construction sites
		â—‹ Have a decent amount of data for noise energy 
		â—‹ Could market it as reducing negative health effects of 
	- Phone charger overheating energy
		â—‹ Using thermoelectric materials 
		â—‹ Already been done for body temperature, which isn't a big temperature difference
		â—‹ Could be used for anything with heat loss - appliances, chargers 
		â—‹ Need to design it as an add-on 
		â—‹ Need to have a cold source - heat sink 
		â—‹ Not very efficient, need to use a transformer 
		â—‹ Is this marketable to the average user?
	- Building ventilation and exhaust
		â—‹ Lots of stakeholders
		â—‹ Either integrated or add on 
		â—‹ Reduce heat output into the world + gain a bit of electricity
		â—‹ May only be able to market to specific climates
		â—‹ Need to look into building codes and regulations 
		â—‹ Can be done with an external combustion engine
		â—‹ Air con exhaust?
	- Wastewater powering IOTs
		â—‹ Not very user centric
		â—‹ Zero head turbines, but requires more infrastructure change
		â—‹ Adding infrastructure is not worth it because it will introduce more maintenance
	- General notes
		â—‹ Like the idea of add ons so we don't need to change existing infrastructure



## [Finalise Evaluating Problem Areas Task](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/23)

Completed the trade-off study of problem areas by doing [the best-of-class chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Y5BLjWYeOzdiXMWd3SZe7I68tTQgj5_khv4GgHinzo/edit?usp=sharing).

## [Review Templates](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/30)

Some templates were created to facilitate the persona creation activity.

## Deciding on structure of the presentation
	- What will we include in our interim presentation?
		â—‹ brainstorming process
		â—‹ Decision process
		â—‹ Interpretation of project brief - how can the heat from ventilation exhaust by converted into useful energy
			Â§ Environment
			Â§ Source
			Â§ Mechanical/mechatronic system 
			Â§ Our preliminary ideas on which 2 of the 4 topics we'll pick
		â—‹ Context
			Â§ Current research available
			Â§ Data available
			Â§ How are we different
			Â§ Regulations and policies 
			Â§ Scientific context
		â—‹ Stakeholders
			Â§ How are we conducting user research
		â—‹ Functional requirements and design constraints
			Â§ Ask Olivia for clarification
		â—‹ Preliminary solution ideas
			Â§ Wind energy - turbine
			Â§ Thermal energy 
			Â§ Sound energy 
		â—‹ Work responsibilities
		â—‹ Schedule for the rest of term 
			Â§ Gantt chart 
	- Functional requirements and design constraints
		â—‹ Not replacing infrastructure 

## Actionables

The following work needs to be delegated:
- [Problem statement](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/19)
- [Creating personas](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/20)
- Ask Olivia :
	- Functional requirements and design constraints - what does this entail?
	- How in depth do we need to go into safety and regulations?
- Interpretation of project brief
- Functional requirements and design constraints 
	
- Organisation of slides 

Less priority work:
- [Prettifying roadmap](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/26)
- [Prettifying problem area brainstorm](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/32)
