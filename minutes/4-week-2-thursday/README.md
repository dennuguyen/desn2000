## [Review of Research Problem Area Task](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/22)

- Skyscraper turbine/ vertical turbines for urban areas
	○ Not ideal to do skyscraper turbines because that's already been done before
	○ Like the idea of vertical turbines on street level to power lamp posts 
- Harvesting energy from human motion from portable devices (shoes, keyboard)
	○ Sources say we can't get enough energy from keyboard keystrokes to power something meaningful 
	○ Could use piezoelectric material from sugarcane waste?
	○ Don't see a huge market for this, as it has already been attempted before with little success
	
- Prosthetic devices
	○ Good option for user-centric design 
	○ Easy to model in CAD 
	○ One topic area will have to be materials
	○ Question for Olivia - how in depth do we need to go into safety and regulations?
- Noise pollution at transport hubs/construction sites
	○ Have a decent amount of data for noise energy 
	○ Could market it as reducing negative health effects of 
- Phone charger overheating energy
	○ Using thermoelectric materials 
	○ Already been done for body temperature, which isn't a big temperature difference
	○ Could be used for anything with heat loss - appliances, chargers 
	○ Need to design it as an add-on 
	○ Need to have a cold source - heat sink 
	○ Not very efficient, need to use a transformer 
	○ Is this marketable to the average user?
- Building ventilation and exhaust
	○ Lots of stakeholders
	○ Either integrated or add on 
	○ Reduce heat output into the world + gain a bit of electricity
	○ May only be able to market to specific climates
	○ Need to look into building codes and regulations 
	○ Can be done with an external combustion engine
	○ Air con exhaust?
- Wastewater powering IOTs
	○ Not very user centric
	○ Zero head turbines, but requires more infrastructure change
	○ Adding infrastructure is not worth it because it will introduce more maintenance
- General notes
	○ Like the idea of add ons so we don't need to change existing infrastructure


## [Finalise Evaluating Problem Areas Task](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/23)

Completed the trade-off study of problem areas by doing [the best-of-class chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Y5BLjWYeOzdiXMWd3SZe7I68tTQgj5_khv4GgHinzo/edit?usp=sharing).

## [Review Templates](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/30)

Some templates were created to facilitate the persona creation activity.

## Actionables

The following work needs to be delegated:
- [Problem statement](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/19)
- [Creating personas](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/20)

Less priority work:
- [Prettifying roadmap](https://gitlab.com/dennuguyen/desn2000/-/issues/26)
