## Finalising Presentation
- Everyone has pretty much finished their sections 
- First run through came in at around 17 minutes
- Went through and discussed sections to slim down, notably:
    - brief interpretation and problem statement - slimmed down info on our process
    - users and stakeholders - cut out deep dive into one specific user story
    - customers needs - 
    - design constraints - cut down explanation of spec constraints
    - preliminary design - restructured slide order and cut down verbosity of slides
- Slimmed down presentation to 11 mins 20 seconds
- Had a discussion about how to engage the audience, and decided on integrating a bit of audience interaction in the "why is this problem important?" section
